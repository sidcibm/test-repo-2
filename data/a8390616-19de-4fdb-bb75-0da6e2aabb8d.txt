Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.
Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects.

Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.
It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
