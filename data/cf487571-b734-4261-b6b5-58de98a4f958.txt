Haskell is a general-purpose, statically-typed, purely functional programming language with type inference and lazy evaluation.
Designed for teaching, research and industrial application, Haskell has pioneered a number of programming language features such as type classes, which enable type-safe operator overloading.
Haskell's main implementation is the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC).
It is named after logician Haskell Curry.
